# Project: Predictive Resource Allocation for Urban Emergency Services

### Overview
This project analyzes over 500,000 911 call records from Montgomery County, PA, to identify key patterns and build a predictive model. The goal is to provide data-driven insights that can help optimize the deployment of emergency service units and improve response times.

### Key Findings & Results
* **Predictive Model:** Developed a Random Forest model that predicts the type of emergency (EMS, Fire, Traffic) with **84% accuracy**.
* **Peak Demand:** Identified a significant **15% spike** in traffic-related incidents during the evening rush hour (5-7 PM).
* **Actionable Insights:** The analysis provides a clear framework for strategically pre-deploying units to known hotspots during peak hours, with a projected potential to reduce response times by up to 10%.

### Technologies Used
* **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **Database:** SQLite
* **BI Tool:** Power BI
